A dedicated **REST API family** has been introduced to enable the programmatic management of dashboards. 

* **New Endpoints:** The following endpoints are now available to manage dashboards:  
  * Clone dashboard  
  * Create dashboard  
  * Delete dashboard  
  * Edit dashboard  
  * List dashboard metadata  
  * Show dashboard  
  * Show dashboard metadata  
  * Create token (for sharing dashboards)  
  * Edit token  
  * Delete token  
* **Embedded Views:** A dashboard can be almost fully managed by the API endpoints. The exception are view-based widgets as they currently rely on the legacy platform. Once view management via the REST API is available, full support for view-related widgets will be added. Until then, it is recommended to create views separately and reference them  with linked view widgets.  
* **Unstable endpoints:** All dashboard related endpoints are initially placed under the `unstable` version and therefore subject to change
