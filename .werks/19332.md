The configuration of individual dashboard elements has been modernized to provide immediate feedback and a more structured workflow.

* **In-Context Configuration:** Similar to dashboard settings, widget configuration is handled without leaving the current dashboard view.  
* **Widget Categories**: Previously, widget creation often started by selecting the visualization type instead of the type of data the user wanted to include. With this werk, the focus has shifted to grouping widgets into categories based on the data type, providing a more logical starting point for configuration.  
* **Guided Configuration Experience:** Previously, widget configuration occurred on a single page, similar to rule configuration, which could be overwhelming due to the possible extensive amount of user input required. A new step-based guided experience, similar to the Quick Setup, has been introduced. The pattern usually follows a **data selection** step followed by the **visualization configuration**.  
* **Live Configuration Preview:** Widget configuration includes a **live configuration preview** that reflects the current setup in real-time, allowing for immediate adjustments.  
* **Applied Filters Context:** In relevant places during the widget configuration, an applied filters context section will be shown. This displays the currently configured filters on the dashboard level which can affect the widget content. This makes it easier to see if any widget-level filters will overwrite those filters, bringing more transparency to the configuration.  
* **Filter Context Integration:** The widget management interface reflects the currently active filter context, ensuring the **live configuration preview** accurately represents the data as it will appear on the current dashboard.
