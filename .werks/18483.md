The error reporting mechanism of special agents only reports the last line of
stderr to the checkmk user interface.

For `agent_ipmi_sensors` the error provided by `ipmitool` or `freeipmi` was
simply handed over, but contained a trailing `\n`.

This lead to the situation, that the error `'.` was reported.

Now, before handing the errors over, the `\n` are replaced so the error fits in
a single line.
