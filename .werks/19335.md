This Werk introduces a completely redesigned visualization dashboard platform, bringing a more intuitive user experience to Checkmk's dashboards.

As part of this transition, dashlets are now referred to as widgets in the UI.

The new dashboard platform was completely built upon the new UI framework. This means that the underlying architecture has completely changed in the way how the dashboard and widgets are rendered and how their specifications are processed. Consequently, any unofficial custom widget implementation will likely no longer function.
