When querying HOST/SERVICE NOTIFICATION log entries, the corresponding host or
service object may not exist on the local site. This happens in two situations:

- **Forwarded notifications**: entries forwarded from remote sites via the
  notification spooler, where the host or service is not configured on the
  central site.
- **Historical notifications**: entries for hosts or services that have since
  been removed from the monitoring configuration.

Previously, this caused the authorization check to always deny access,
preventing users from seeing these notifications unless they had the
"See all hosts & services" permission.

Now, when the host or service object is not found locally, the system falls back
to verifying whether the querying user matches the notification’s contact name.
This change allows users who are the designated contacts to view these
notifications even when the related host or service objects are no longer
present.

No configuration changes are required to benefit from this improvement.
