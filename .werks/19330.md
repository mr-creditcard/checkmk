This Werk introduces a new “Responsive” layout system for dashboards, in addition to the existing “Anchored” layout system.

* **Row & Column Based:** Unlike the anchored layout system, the new layout is based on a flexible grid of rows and columns.   
* **Responsive Grid & Screen Breakpoints:** The layout automatically adjusts based on the current screen size through a system of multiple sub-layouts. A specific sub-layout becomes active depending on the current screen breakpoint with its own defined number of available columns  
* **Sub-layout Customization:** Each screen-size breakpoint has its own independent layout with a dedicated widget arrangement. Widget position and size can be configured separately for each breakpoint without affecting the others. Configuration is currently performed by resizing the screen to activate the corresponding layout.  
* **Automatic Widget Layout Allocation:** When adding a new widget via the UI, the dashboard automatically handles the positioning and sizing across all sub-layouts to provide a consistent responsive experience.  
* **REST API Endpoints:** Because the layout data structure differs significantly from the anchored layout, the responsive dashboard uses its own dedicated set of API endpoints. When managing widgets via the API, the user is responsible for providing specific layout configurations for each sub-layout.
