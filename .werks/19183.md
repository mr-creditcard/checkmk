In its current state, when differences in the frozen aggregation were detected,
a full live aggregation tree is displayed. The issue was that it was quite
difficult to see what exactly differed, particularly when the aggregation was
large.

To improve this, two changes were made. Firstly, warning indicators (⚠️) are now
displayed on parent nodes that have differences, enabling quicker detection.
Secondly, a new _Show only aggregation differences_ option was added to the
display options, which enables the user to filter only on its differences.

With both these improvements, we believe that users will now be able to quickly
discover what has actually changed.

Since this is only a change to the user interface, no changes to your setup are
required to benefit from these improvements.
