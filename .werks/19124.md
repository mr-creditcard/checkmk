When the time source of a monitored device changed (e.g. from epoch
timestamps to sysUpTime after a 2.2 to higher version migration), the averaging
calculation could get stuck. The backward time jump caused the averaged values
to remain frozen indefinitely, never incorporating new measurements.

Checkmk now detects such backward time jumps and resets its internal time
tracking while preserving the previously computed average. This allows
averaging to resume normally with the new time source without losing history.
