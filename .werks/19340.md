The "Check State of BI Aggregation" active check plugin (`bi_aggr`) has been removed.
It was deprecated in Werk #17346 in favor of the *BI Aggregations* special agent.

Please migrate any existing rules of type "Check State of BI Aggregation" to the
*BI Aggregations* special agent before upgrading.
