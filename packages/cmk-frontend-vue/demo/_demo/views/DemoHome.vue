      <h1>The single source of truth for Checkmk UI components</h1>
      <p>
        Explore, understand, and use Vue UI components consistently across Checkmk — with real
        behavior, real code, and no guesswork.

          <li>Discover which UI components exist</li>
          <li>See how components look and behave in reality</li>
          <li>Understand supported variants and states</li>
          <li>Access example usage and source code snippets</li>
          <li>Reduce ambiguity and rework across teams</li>

      <h2>Components</h2>
      <p>
        Components are reusable, functional UI building blocks built on top of the foundations that
        meet specific interaction needs. They are designed to be consistent, accessible, and
        scalable, and are implemented in Vue for use across different use cases and projects.
