The S3 backup target now allows configuring a custom endpoint URL. 

This enables users to store backups with S3-compatible providers such as Backblaze or MinIO, expanding backup options beyond the default AWS S3 service. To use this feature, specify the desired endpoint URL in your backup target settings. No additional setup steps are required.
